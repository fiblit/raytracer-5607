# Dalton Hildreth, ***REMOVED*** #

OS: Ubunutu 14.04 LTS 
🐧 (<- this is a penguin in unicode, if you can't see it.)
If you haven't looked it up yet, look it up. It's kinda cute.

Compile:
Run "make raytrace" (or just "make" apparently) in the local directory. It will
place the "raytrace" executable in a bin directory, and the *.o files in an obj
directory.


How to Run:

raytrace [input_file] [output_file]

The input and output files both require the extensions .txt and .ppm
respectively. If no output file is specified it is assumed to be named the same
as the input_file except with the .ppm extension. If neither parameter is given
the program will prompt for the input file and output file.
