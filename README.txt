Compile:
Run "make raytrace" (or just "make" apparently) in the local directory. It will place the "raytrace" executable in a bin directory, and the *.o files in an obj directory.

How to Run:
You can call the program in one of two ways. You can simply call it via "./raytrace" or "raytrace" (depending on your $PATH settings). If you do, the program terminal will prompt you for the input file name. You can also call it via "./raytrace <path_to_scenefile>" or "raytrace <path_to_scenefile>" (Again depends on your $PATH, just do the first for a gaurentee). The <path_to_scenefile> parameter does not require the "./" unlike the program executable.
