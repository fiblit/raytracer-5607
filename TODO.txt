Implement material (in particular, into object/sphere)
  -Fix n being accepted as a double in IO
Add phong illumination model to shadeRay
Add light class
Shadow stuff???
Do cylinder intersection math
Add cylinder class
Optional:
  Change imgBuf to an actual 2D array
  Change each sphere holding material to a reference to a material table. (too much space)

And, of course, everything else!
