Implement/test Cylinders
Add endcaps/finite to cylinders
Change imgBuf to an actual 2D array
Change isDouble to detect doubles without the leading 0. (e.g ".5" or "-.7")
Change each sphere holding material to a reference to a material table. (too much space)
Data cleanup
And, of course, everything else!
