Add Triangle Shading
Add Triangle Texturing
Draw&Make/Find (obj) Scenes
Data cleanup (need to delete stuff here and there, run valgrind)
Change each sphere holding material to a reference to a material table. (too much space)
(Optional) Add -o delimiter for outputs in the command-line. (e.g. raytrace inputfiles -o outputfiles)
(Optional) Increase makefile generalization (e.g. put source in src. Essentially organize.)
(Optional) Add cylinder Texturing (Is "impossible" for infinite cylinders)
(delayed) Add optional finite parameters to cylinders
(indefinitely delayed) Add endcaps to cylinders (TODO fix bug, start from scratch)

And, of course, everything else!
