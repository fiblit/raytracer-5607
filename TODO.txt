Model that awesome scene idea (Battle of the Hill) : Warning the renderer is severely limiting in comparison to my imagination
Model that OTHER scene idea (Constellation room)
Clean up memory errors

# EVERYTHING AFTER THIS POINT IS INDEFINITELY DELAYED #

(Optional?) Add stack for hollow spheres
(Optional) Add handler functions for getInFileData
(Optional) add distributed ray tracing for reflection and transmission
(Optional) Add keywords to make distributed (on reflections/transmission )ray tracing optional
  ^^ This may include adding more to mtlcolor or a mtlprop class/keyword
(delayed) Fix numerical error bugs


(Optional) Add -o delimiter for outputs in the command-line. (e.g. raytrace inputfiles -o outputfiles)
(Optional) Increase makefile generalization (e.g. put source in src. Essentially organize.)
(Optional) Change each sphere holding material to a reference to a material table. (too much space)
(Optional) Remove textureCoord (Not really helpful :P)
(Optional) Add cylinder Texturing (Is "impossible" for infinite cylinders)

(indefinitely delayed) Add optional finite parameters to cylinders
(indefinitely delayed) Add endcaps to cylinders (TODO fix bug, start from scratch)

And, of course, everything else!
