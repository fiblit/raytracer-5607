(Optional) Add -o delimiter for outputs in the command-line. (e.g. raytrace inputfiles -o outputfiles)
(Optional) Increase makefile generalization (e.g. put source in src. Essentially organize.)
(Optional) Add Texture tiling
(Optional) Change each sphere holding material to a reference to a material table. (too much space)
(Optional) Remove textureCoord (Not really helpful :P)
(Optional) Add cylinder Texturing (Is "impossible" for infinite cylinders)
(delayed) Add optional finite parameters to cylinders
(indefinitely delayed) Add endcaps to cylinders (TODO fix bug, start from scratch)

And, of course, everything else!
